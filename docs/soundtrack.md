# Potential Soundtrack

The following list is based on the incidental music included in Oregon Trail II, as
noted in *Oregon Trail II: The Official Strategy Guide*, published by Prima.

Depending on space available in the ROM and time constraints, I probably won't use all
of these, but it's good to have options available.

I also tracked "Home on the Range" as the title song. Yes, it's anachronistic probably, but who cares?
