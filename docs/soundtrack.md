# Potential Soundtrack

The following list is based on the incidental music included in Oregon Trail II, as
noted in *Oregon Trail II: The Official Strategy Guide*, published by Prima.

[Songs and Dances of the Oregon Trail][williamsdances] has a list of even more songs and dances. Some dances might be good traveling music, or even for fort landmarks? And perhaps the end (the Willamette Valley)?

Depending on space available in the ROM and time constraints, I probably won't use all
of these, but it's good to have options available.

I'm limited by FamiTone2 to 17 songs per data file, so I'll probably need to have two audio data files given there's about sixteen or seventeen landmarks plus a title song. And if I want different traveling music...

I also tracked "Home on the Range" as the title song. Yes, it's anachronistic probably, but who cares?
