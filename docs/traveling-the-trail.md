# Notes on Traveling the Trail
(this is based on notes from https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/appleii/579985-the-oregon-trail/faqs/9660
as well as my own guesstimations.)

## Rations
* Filling = three pounds of food per person per day
* Meager = two " " " " " " "
* Bare bones = one " " " " " " "

## Travel distance per day
Up to Fort Laramie, you can travel a maximum of forty miles per day. After Fort Laramie, you
can travel a maximum of twenty-four miles per day. To this maximum, apply the following multipliers:

* Yoke of oxen (1 yoke of oxen = 50%, 2 yoke of oxen = 75%, 3+ yoke of oxen = 100%)
* Pace (Steady = 50%, Strenuous = 75%, Grueling = 100%)

For example, if you're not yet to Fort Laramie, you have two yoke of oxen, and you're doing a strenuous
pace, you will travel the following distance per day:

40 * 75% * 75% = 22.5 (round to 23)
