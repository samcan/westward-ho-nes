# Trail notes
Following are assorted notes on the Trail, sourced from various sources.

* "The first weeks of travel in the spring were generally very difficult....The
snows had just melted, so the trails were like mud bogs. Most families had no
idea how to pack and wound up with dangerously top-heavy or unbalanced loads.
Oxen became entangled in their ropes at night and sometimes, breaking free,
wandered off." ([source][davidahl])
* "River crossings slowed the journey through Kansas and Nebraska, and most
wagon trains took about three weeks to travel the 175 miles to the ford
across the Big Blue River in southern Nebraska known as Independence Crossing." ([source][davidahl])
* "About six miles northwest of [the Big Blue River], trails from St. Joseph
and Fort Leavenworth converged, thence following the Platte River to Fort
Kearney....The Platte River marked the beginning of buffalo country..." ([source][davidahl])
* "Along the North Platte River Valley, the wagons could generally make a speed
of about two miles per hour, thus covering, in a good day, about 15 to 18 miles.
If it had been possible to maintain this speed for the entire journey, the
2040 miles from Independence to Oregon City could have been covered in
about 4 1/2 months. However, everything seemed to conspire to slow the trip:
river crossings, Indian and bandit attacks, hunting, burying the dead, wagon
breakdowns, muddy trails, oxen wandering off, and losing the trail. Some wagon
trains even rested on Sunday, observing it as a day of worship and, more often
than not, repair." ([source][davidahl])
* "...[A]ll trails converged ... for the long ascent to South Pass across the
Continental Divide. Even in mid-July, the steep mountain walls often blocked
the sun, and snow and ice frequently covered the ground. The ascent ... was
long and gradual, and the South Pass many miles in width. Hence the only real
hindrances to good progress were the occasional snow and damage to wagon wheels
from the rocky trail....Beyond the South Pass, the trail began a gradual but
rocky descent of about 60 miles, across the Green River near the Wyoming-Idaho
border. This crossing was an extremely dangerous one; the river was wide, deep,
powerful, and ice cold." ([source][davidahl])
* "...[O]ne more barrier loomed between the settlers and the Promised Land: the
terrible Blue Mountains. Several times during the crossing of these mountains,
wagons had to be lowered with ropes from one part of the trail to another, and
canyon walls too narrow for the wagons frequently had to be chipped away. Wagons
were often abandoned, their occupants continuing the journey on foot. Others,
searching for a better route, became hopelessly lost and eventually died of
hunger and thirst. John Kerns, in his diary, recorded this about the Blue
Mountains: '…it was the roughest road we have encountered on the journey, being
up and down sidling mountains, into the brush and across a creek every 200 or
300 yards, and over stony places enough to hide all despairing sinners.'" ([source][davidahl])
* "From Walla Walla, Washington, on, still 250 miles across Oregon to the
coastal settlements, most travelers kept going, driven by sheer exhilaration
and determination. By all accounts, it was one of the most difficult parts
of the journey. As Medorem Crawford, an emigrant traveler, recorded, 'From
Walla Walla to Willamette Falls (Oregon City) occupied about 20 days, and,
all things considered, was the hardest part of the entire journey—what with
drifting sands, rocky cliffs, and rapid streams along the Columbia, and the
gorges, torrents, and thickets of the Cascade Mountains...'" ([source][davidahl])
